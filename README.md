# Amazon Product Recommendation System

This project is a **Product Recommendation System** built using Python. It utilizes **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** for recommending similar products based on features like price and rank. The project also includes a **search functionality** and a GUI interface for user interaction.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Extracts relevant fields from the dataset.
  - Handles missing values by imputing median values for missing `price` and `rank`.

- **Search Functionality**:
  - Allows users to search for products by their title.
  - Provides suggestions if no exact matches are found.

- **Recommendation Engine**:
  - Recommends similar products using `k-NN` based on price and rank.

- **GUI Interface**:
  - Users can search for products, view results, and get recommendations through an intuitive GUI built with **Tkinter**.
